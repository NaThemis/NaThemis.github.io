These are challenging centralized data platforms and Lakehouse architectures, not to replace them, but to complement them. The Data Fabric architecture then appears as a hybrid and modular approach allowing a more agile integration of AI Agents into the existing ecosystem. An emerging contradiction? While the evolution of data architectures seemed to be following a linear trajectory towards more decentralization with Data Mesh , the rise of AI agents raises the question of the future of traditional data platforms. Data Platforms: Evolution of architectures and emergence of new approaches. Data platforms play a critical role in data management and analysis within companies. Depending on their needs, their volume of data and their uses, different architectures have developed over time.

The image below shows the main types of Data Platform structures : [ ](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3396758c-cfde-4b23-95e4-485bea6e6e60_468x263.png) In this context, 3 tools are made up of these Data Platforms. Tool 1 - Data Warehouse A Data Warehouse is a centralized database designed for analyzing structured data. It stores transformed and cleansed data from various sources in a unified format, facilitating business analytics and BI ( Business Intelligence ) reporting. Features: Relational model optimized for complex SQL queries. Highly governed and validated data. Use cases: Reporting, analytical dashboards. Examples: Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift.

Tool 2 - Data Lake A Data Lake allows large amounts of raw data to be stored in its native format, whether structured, semi-structured, or unstructured. This approach is especially useful for advanced analytics and machine learning . Features : Massive, low-cost storage, often cloud-based. Raw data retention with on-demand transformation. Use cases: Big Data analysis, AI, log management, IoT data. Examples: Amazon S3, Azure Data Lake, Hadoop HDFS. Tool 3 - Data Lakehouse The Lakehouse is a hybrid approach combining the strengths of the Data Warehouse and the Data Lake . It combines the flexibility and scalability of raw data storage from a Data Lake with the advanced management features and governance mechanisms of a Data Warehouse, ensuring high data quality. Features : Storage of raw and structured data in a single environment. Support for SQL queries and advanced processing ( Python, Spark, new analytics, and machine learning usecases ).

Strengthened governance with metadata management and ACID transactions ( e.g. Delta Lake ). Use case : Businesses that require both analytics and operational data management. Examples : Databricks, Delta Lake. These tools are particularly effective for operational analysis and reporting. However, they rely on centralization and involve the duplication of data, which can lead to governance issues, data quality issues, and in some cases, foster the proliferation of data silos. In this sense, a more global data strategy is essential, which can be found in the 2 methodologies below. Methodology 1 - Data Mesh Data mesh is a decentralized architecture where data is managed as a product by the business teams that create it. Rather than a single, centralized platform, each business area (sales, marketing, logistics, etc.) is responsible for its own data and exposes it via standardized interfaces.

Features : Reduced silos and improved scalability. Empower business teams with a global governance framework. Use case: Businesses with distributed teams and complex needs. Methodology 2 - Data Fabric Unlike previous models, this approach creates a web of intelligent connections between different data sources, regardless of format or location. AI plays a key role in automating the integration, governance, and management of data flows. Features : Intelligent integration and interconnection of data sources. Automation of discovery, governance, and security processes. Use case: Organizations with heterogeneous systems requiring smooth and optimized interconnection.

However, it also has limitations, including high maintenance costs, the risk of errors related to duplication and a lack of flexibility in the face of new uses. A challenge to traditional data platforms? The emergence of generative AI is disrupting this traditional vision of data management. AI Agent models such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot or Gemini demonstrate that it is possible to access and exploit data without going through aggregation and centralized transformation. This capability challenges the very necessity of traditional data platforms and questions their relevance in a world where users can, with just a few clicks, create their own AI Agents connected directly to existing data sources.

Augmented Data Platforms with AI Agents Data Platforms will not disappear, but their role is evolving. The challenge is no longer just to centralize, but to enable controlled and intelligent access to data, while integrating the capabilities of generative AI. The key lies in a hybrid approach, combining flexibility, governance and scalability to meet the new challenges posed by AI and the decentralization of uses. Unlike traditional platforms, which centralize and transform data before it is used, AI agents operate directly on the sources, analyzing and acting in real time.

Regulation and governance : Supervise the use of data to ensure compliance with the standards in force. What type of architecture can integrate this decentralized structure of AI Agents? A hybrid approach combining centralization and decentralization is more likely.
